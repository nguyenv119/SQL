# SQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL

Hey there,

This is a log of my SQL practices. I began learning mySQL from practically scratch for an internship to get better at organizing data.
By the end of the summer, I hope to be able to have a good understanding of manipulating relational databases, using SQL, SQLite and PostgreSQL

Please reach out with any questions,

Enjoy your stay!
